# text_to_speech
Here I used bark AI.
Bark is a transformer-based text-to-audio model. Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio - including music, background noise and simple sound effects.
The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughing, sighing and crying.
## The bark model is trained on more than 120 speakers. We can use the names of those speakers to convert text into their respective voices.
## I also added ouput audio.
